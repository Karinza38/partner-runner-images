## About

This repository contains the information about the VM images provided by GitHub partners which can be used on [GitHub-hosted larger runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-larger-runners).

Partner images are VM images which are created by third parties which GitHub Hosted Action runner customers can use to improve particular use cases in their workflow by providing particular tools in 'one click' to work with.

## Image Definitions

### Beta

The purpose of a Beta is to collect feedback on an image before it is released to GA. 
The goal of a Beta is to identify and fix any potential issues that exist on that image. 
Images are updated on a cadence owned by the third party who provided the image, please see the image information above. 
Any workflows that run on a beta image do not fall under the customer [SLA](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-online-services-sla) in place for Actions.
Customers choosing to use Beta images are encouraged to provide feedback in the [partner-runner-images repo](https://github.com/actions/partner-runner-images/issues/new/choose) by creating an issue. 
A Beta may take on different availability, i.e. public vs private.

### GA

A GA (General Availability) image has been through a Beta period and is deemed ready for general use. Images are updated on a weekly cadence. In order to be moved to
GA the image must meet the following criteria:

1. Has been through a Beta period (public or private)
2. Most major software we install on the image has a compatible version for the underlying OS
3. All major bugs reported during the Beta period have been addressed

Any workflows that run on a partner image do not fall under the customer [SLA](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-online-services-sla) as GitHub cannot commit to the partner updating the image within these timeframes. 

## Software and Image Support

- Updates to each image are owned and managed by the partner providing the image, not GitHub
- GitHub makes no warranties or guarantees for the images or their contents
